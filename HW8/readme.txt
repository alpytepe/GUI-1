This is a basic scrabble game. 
-Tiles can be dragged and dropped only on board spots
-Included the entire scrabble board with bonus tiles
-Scores get saved and tallied
-Board is cleared after each round (mostly because I couldnt figure out how to save all words played)
-Doesn't check to see if words are in the dictionary or not

Very basic stuff, but it works.
