HW3

This assignment took a lot of time for me because for some reason, 
The text wouldn't shift as I resized the web page, but now it should
work just fine. 

I used a lot of code snippets from w3schools. It took a lot of trial and
error to figure out the right colours and sizes, and i was pretty liberal
with a fair bit of the css (in terms of sizing, location and stuff). 

I also had help from a quite a bunch of stack overflow forums on how
I could fix small aspects of my code.
